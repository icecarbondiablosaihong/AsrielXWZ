          Although this might sound a bit cliché (especially for a unique art student like me), I’ve loved collecting objects and taking beautiful photos of them since I was young. People constantly extract materials from nature through various processing methods for their own use. For example, plastic is derived from petroleum, made into toys, and eventually ends up in my hands… This series, *Entree*, explores the connection to nature through the objects I’ve collected and photographed. It reflects humanity's harmful and transformative exploitation of resources, the recreation of natural life through human-made representations, and an awe for the wonders of nature. It also serves as a showcase of my coding skills developed during my first-year interaction course.
